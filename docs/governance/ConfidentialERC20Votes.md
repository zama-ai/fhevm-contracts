# ConfidentialERC20Votes

This contract inherits ConfidentialERC20, EIP712, and Ownable2Step. This is based on the Comp.sol contract written by
Compound Labs. see: compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/Governance/Comp.sol. It is a governance
token used to delegate votes, which can be used by contracts such as GovernorAlphaZama.sol. It uses encrypted votes to
delegate the voting power associated with an account's balance.

_The delegation of votes leaks information about the account's encrypted balance to the `delegatee`._

## BlockNumberEqualOrHigherThanCurrentBlock

```solidity
error BlockNumberEqualOrHigherThanCurrentBlock()
```

Returned if the `blockNumber` is higher or equal to the (current) `block.number`.

_It is returned in requests to access votes._

## GovernorInvalid

```solidity
error GovernorInvalid()
```

Returned if the `msg.sender` is not the `governor` contract.

## SignatureExpired

```solidity
error SignatureExpired()
```

Returned if the signature has expired.

## SignatureNonceInvalid

```solidity
error SignatureNonceInvalid()
```

Returned if the signature's nonce is invalid.

## SignatureVerificationFail

```solidity
error SignatureVerificationFail()
```

Returned if the signature's verification has failed.

_See {SignatureChecker} for potential reasons._

## DelegateChanged

```solidity
event DelegateChanged(address delegator, address fromDelegate, address toDelegate)
```

Emitted when an `account` (i.e. `delegator`) changes its delegate.

## DelegateVotesChanged

```solidity
event DelegateVotesChanged(address delegate)
```

Emitted when a `delegate` account's vote balance changes.

## NewGovernor

```solidity
event NewGovernor(address governor)
```

Emitted when the governor contract that can reencrypt votes changes.

_WARNING: it can be set to a malicious contract, which could reencrypt all user votes._

## NonceIncremented

```solidity
event NonceIncremented(address account, uint256 newNonce)
```

Emitted when the account cancels a signature.

## Checkpoint

A checkpoint for marking number of votes from a given block.

_In Compound's implementation, `fromBlock` is defined as uint32 to allow tight-packing. However, in this implementations
`votes` is uint256-based. `fromBlock`'s type is set to uint256, which simplifies the codebase._

### Parameters
